    <h1>Sport in our environment</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Sport is considered by many as a talent. I personally at the time of writing this article highly disagree with this. Sport has been found out to be more of interaction and finding a way to put stress off our minds. This really explains the reason as to why 
        'sports men and women' turn out to be great in the different fields they are absorbed into. I would love to therefore explain to you some of the different sports common in our country.
