    <h1>NETBALL</h1>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
    Netball, popular game in girls’ schools in England and several other British Commonwealth countries, similar to six-player girls’ basketball in the United States.
    It is played on a hard-surfaced rectangular court 100 feet long and 50 feet wide (30 by 15 metres), clearly marked into three zones with half circles 16 feet in radius at either end for shooting.
    The goalposts stand 10 feet high with ringed nets at the top through which the ball must pass from above to score a point.
    The rings are 15 inches (38 cm) in diameter, and the ball is of leather or rubber, about 8.5 inches in diameter and 14–16 ounces (400–450 grams) in weight.
    The game is played between two teams, each consisting of seven players—three centre players, two attackers, and two defenders, with each player restricted in movement to certain areas of the court.
    The ball must be passed from hand to hand from player to player, and no one may run with it.
    The centre players try to pass the ball up the court into the circle for the attackers to shoot (only the two attackers may shoot).
    The defenders, by guarding their opponents and by intercepting passes, try to prevent goals from being scored.
    A game consists of four 15-minute periods or two 20-minute halves.
    At the beginning of the 21st century, there were more than two million netball players worldwide.
    In 1998 netball became a medal sport at the Commonwealth Games.
